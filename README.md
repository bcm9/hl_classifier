This project demonstrates a gradient boosting machine learning approach to predict hearing impairment using synthetic audiology data. The dataset includes features such as age, pure-tone average, speech discrimination scores, noise exposure, family history, and occupation. A probabilistic approach is used to model hearing loss based on a combination of these factors.
